Space Invaders is a classic arcade game released in 1978. It is a fixed 2D shooter game where the player controls a laser cannon which they can move to the right or left while firing lasers. The payer's target is a fleet of alien ships which pan left and right while slowly moving closer to the ground. The goal of the game is to keep the alien ships from landing on the ground.

This version was completely hand rolled using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and EaselJS.
